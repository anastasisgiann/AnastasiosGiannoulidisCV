🌐 Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio site, built with React and CSS, showcasing who I am, what I’m learning, and the projects I’ve built so far. The site is fully component-based, clean, and simple — designed to highlight my journey as a developer.

🚀 Overview

The website is structured into three main sections:

1. Header / Intro Section

Includes a photo of me

A short introduction about who I am

Links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and CV

Styled using custom CSS and built as a standalone React component

2. Courses Section

A section highlighting the courses I’m currently learning from:

JavaScript

HTML/CSS/JS (general web foundations)

React

Implemented using React props

Data for each course comes from a dedicated array file, making the component dynamic, reusable, and easy to expand

3. Projects Section

Displays my 3 projects

Uses useState to dynamically update the project displayed

Each project corresponds to a menu button with the project’s name

Clicking a button updates the content based on that project

A clean and simple example of interactive UI built with React state management
